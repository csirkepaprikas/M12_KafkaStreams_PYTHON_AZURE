This task is the second in a set of two tasks on streaming, and it focused on Kafka aspects and the Kafka Streams framework for implementing streaming solutions.
Through this assignment, I gained experience working with the Kafka Streams framework and became familiar with the enrichment process of data in streaming applications.
By the end of the task, I had practical skills in using Kafka Streams to implement streaming solutions and enrich streaming data, which are important skills for working with real-time data at scale.
